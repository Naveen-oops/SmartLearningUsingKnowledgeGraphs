        <h3 className='about-project'>About the project:</h3>
        Our project aims in helping students to learn visually with the help of knowledge graphs(or concept maps). The Graphs for various subjects will be available separately and can be used by students to learn interactively. All graphs are made in such a way to make visual impact to learners such that it is easy to read and interpret. 
        
        <h3>Why <b><font color="#0070f3">Edu</font>Graph</b>?</h3>
        In today’s world student cannot rely on single source of textbook for learning. The knowledge is scattered around the internet. The internet is a good way to access all knowledge, but the main problem is that there is too much data which makes the reader overwhelming.
        
        <h3>Power of visualization:</h3>
        A picture tells more than a 1000 words… Picture have been used to convey information long before the development of writing. Humans can understand visual data more easily than lengthy texts.

        <h3>Technologies involved:</h3>
        NLP, Data visualization, Web technology
